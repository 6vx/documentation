# Installing from CLI

Strapi CLI (Command Line Interface) installation scripts are the fastest way to get Strapi running locally. The following guide is the installation option most recommended by Strapi.

## Preparing the installation

The CLI installation guide requires 2 softwares to be already installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): only LTS versions are supported (version 12.x minimum). Other versions of Node.js may not be compatible with the latest release of Strapi. The 14.x version is most recommended by Strapi.
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) (version 6.x minimum) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to run the CLI installation scripts.

A database is also required for any Strapi project. Strapi currently supports the following databases:

::: warning WARNING
Starting from the release of Strapi v4, MongoDB is not supported natively anymore and no connector is available. For more information, please refer to [the official communication on the topic](https://strapi.io/blog/mongo-db-support-in-strapi-past-present-and-future).
:::

| Database   | Minimum version |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| SQLite     | 3               |
| PostgreSQL | 10              |
| MySQL      | 5.6             |
| MariaDB    | 10.1            |
| MongoDB    | 3.6             |

## Creating a Strapi project

::: danger ðŸ¤“ CLI installation options
The following installation guide covers the most basic installation option using the CLI. There are however other options that can be used when creating a new Strapi project:

- Using the `--quickstart` flag at the end of the command to directly create the project in quickstart mode.
- Using the `--template` flag at the end of the command to create a project with pre-made Strapi configurations (see [Templates](templates.md)).

Strapi also offers a starters CLI to create a project with a pre-made frontend application (see [our dedicated blog post](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-the-strapi-starter-cli)).
:::


1. In a terminal, run the following command:

:::: tabs card
::: tab npm
 ```sh
  npx create-strapi-app my-project
  ```
::: 
::: tab yarn
 ```sh
  yarn create strapi-app my-project
 ```
:::

2. Choose an installation type:
   * `Quickstart (recommended)`, which uses the default database (SQLite)
   * `Custom (manual settings)`, which allows to choose your preferred database

3. (Custom installation type only) Among the list of databases, choose a database for your Strapi project.

4. (Custom installation type only) Name your project's database.

## Running Strapi

To start the Strapi application, run the following command in the project folder:

:::: tabs card
::: tab npm
```bash
npm run develop
```
:::

::: tab yarn
```sh
yarn develop
```
:::

<!-- ### Creating a project with starters

A [starter](https://strapi.io/starters) is a premade front-end application linked to a [template](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/templates.md) with pre-configured content types, components, dynamic zones or plugins. Using the starter CLI is the quickest way to kickstart a full stack project with Strapi.

To create a project with the starter CLI, run this command:

<code-group>
<code-block title="NPM">
```bash
npx create-strapi-starter my-project <starter-url>
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn create strapi-starter my-project <starter-url>
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

where `<starter-url>` is the full Github URL for the starter, or its shorthand. The shorthand can be found at the bottom of the corresponding starter page.

This will create a mono repository, install dependencies, and start the application automatically.

:::tip
The project can be created from a specific branch, if specified in the url (e.g.: `https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-gatsby-blog/tree/<my-branch>`).
:::

If you need an application that is preconfigured for a specific use case, but the existing [starters](#creating-a-project-with-starters) do not suit your use case, you can use [Templates](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/templates.md) or [create an empty project](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.md#creating-a-project-without-starters).
### Creating a project without starters

To quickly create an empty project, run this command:

<code-group>
<code-block title="NPM">
```sh
npx create-strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

This will create a mono repository, install dependencies, and start the application automatically.

::: tip
The `--quickstart` flag sets the database to SQLite. To use another database, run the command without the flag, and select `Custom (manual settings)` when prompted for installation type.
:::

::: warning
When using a custom database, it has to be up and running before creating the Strapi project.
